### Checklist

## 14. AI-Assisted Card Generation
The Technorox card generation pipeline will leverage **OpenAI models** for:

- **Card Concept Generation:** AI-assisted creation of card lore, abilities, and unique creature ideas.
- **Procedural Art Prompts:** AI-generated prompts for image generation tools to maintain consistent art style.
- **Stat Balancing:** Use AI to propose balanced stats based on meta-data from matches.
- **Expansion Planning:** Automatically propose new mechanics and card sets.

This ensures **rapid iteration**, **scalability**, and **consistent style** across thousands of cards.

---

## 15. SEO and Rendering Strategy
Technorox will implement a **dual rendering strategy** to maximize SEO performance while keeping the game experience smooth:

- **Marketing Pages:** 
  - The home page, about page, register page, and other marketing content will use **Static Site Generation (SSG)** or **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** (via frameworks like Next.js or Astro).
  - Pre-rendered HTML ensures proper SEO indexing, rich search snippets, and fast first-contentful-paint times.
  - Pages will include structured metadata, Open Graph tags, and schema.org markup.

- **Game Client:** 
  - The actual trading card game (TCG) client will remain a **Single-Page Application (SPA)** built with Phaser for seamless game interactions.
  - SEO is not a concern for this portion since it is accessed after authentication.

- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Marketing content will be on `technorox.com`, optimized for search and social previews.
  - The game client will run at `play.technorox.com`, optimized for performance and user retention.

This approach ensures Technorox is discoverable on search engines while keeping the actual game performant.

Each chip is infused with encrypted data, making them both a universal currency and a badge of status among competitors. Players earn and spend Rox Chips to unlock new cards, cosmetics, and strategic options, tying the economy directly into the game's lore and progression.
